# personas
Collateral for creating user personas and suggested Brigade standards.

There is a finished printable collection of 5 personas created as a google doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SkwYK-yP0yzUghfPXDozu5_ApUfu_HAw7XNMZJPUHSc/edit)  for National Day of Civic Hacking that completes this project. The google doc can be copied for reuse or editing to customize for individual projects and serves as a template for the project in the box initiative. For more information about this project See the project brief google document titled  "User Personas - SFBrigade core initiative" at https://goo.gl/FVxBqA
